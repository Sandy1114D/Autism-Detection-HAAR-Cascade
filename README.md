# Autism-Detection-HAAR-Cascade
A real-time autism detection system using HAAR Cascade Classifier and OpenCV in Python. This project showcases how machine learning and computer vision can support early autism screening through facial feature analysis.
# 🧠 Autism Detection Using HAAR Cascade Machine Learning Algorithm

## 📌 Description
This project is a real-time autism detection prototype using the HAAR Cascade Classifier and OpenCV in Python. It utilizes facial feature recognition as a base for identifying early indicators of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The project aims to demonstrate how computer vision and machine learning can assist in building accessible tools for healthcare support and early screening.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Facial data preprocessing with OpenCV
- Uses HAAR Cascade for efficient face localization
- Lightweight and fast — runs on most basic systems
- Easily extendable to full ML models or CNNs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- HAAR Cascade Classifier  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (optional)
